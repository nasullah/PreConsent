<p> This system is designed to manage and monitor progress for recruitment to the 100k Genomes project, and show how well the Oxford Partnership GMC is meeting its contractual targets.  It allows the user to record various events in the recruitment of cancer patients, automating the production of emails and contact logs, and it offers a dashboard of relevant performance metrics and indicators gleaned from several hospital systems.</p>
<p> The system was commissioned by Anna Schuh, and designed and developed by Nasullah Kahlid Alham, Kerrie Woods, Jim Davies and Steve Harris.  Enquiries and support calls should be addressed to <a href="mailto:steve.harris@ndcls.ox.ac.uk" target="_top"> Steve Harris</a>.</p>
